The player statistics are the main part of HT-History. They are presented as a list - one row per player that appeared at least once in the matches defined by the [Match\_filter](Match_filter.md).

Each stat for the player is shown in a column. There are a couple of columns/stats available. Since showing all of them would be very confusing, only a few of them are shown at once.

Which ones are shown is defined by the 'column set'. The column set can be changed by the dropdown box in the upper right area.

New column set can be created there as well by selecting the "create new" option. All column sets - except the 'Default' set - can be configured by clicking the 'Columns' button.
