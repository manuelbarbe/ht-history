#summary How to use the "Choose team" dialog

At startup and after clicking the button "Change team", HT-History asks you to input a team ID. HT-History will gather stats only for the input team ID.

Additionally you are able to select the time period of interest. Only matches within the selected period are evaluated. Please note that this has no effect to transfer statistics.
