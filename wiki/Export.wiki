#summary How to export data

The [Players] stats page allows you to export all shown columns. To do so, select some players (use CTRL) and right-click the selection.

You are then able to export the selected players to a CSV file or copy as HT board code to the clipboard. If you select only one single player, the complete list is exported instead.
