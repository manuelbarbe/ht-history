#summary How to use the match filter

The upper area on the [Main_screen] shows the match filter.

Let's think of this as a pre-filter, that filters all available matches before they are passed to the statistics calculators. However, the statistics calculators may perform additional filtering (see [Columns])

You are able to multiselect items in the boxes by holding CTRL and clicking the items.

If you change the filters 'Opponent ID', 'Type', 'Venue', 'Forfaits' or 'Season', the stats in the bottom area are auto-updated. The button "Change team / refresh"  is only needed to change the selected team ID (see [Choose_team]) or to refresh data from the CHPP servers (e.g. a match has recently finished).
